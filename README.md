# SpaceX Launch Tracker

This project aims to use React to display and compare data extracted from the SpaceX api by jackwmeyer. This API gives data on specific launches and branches out with a number of different endpoints to display the launch details, rocket details, payload details and more.

## Development Process

### Highlights 
Some things i'm really proud of is the featued launch section on the home page, and the imagery over the whole page looks pretty good.

### Challenges
Because this was my first React project, there were a lot of new concepts and features that provided a bit of a learning curve.
